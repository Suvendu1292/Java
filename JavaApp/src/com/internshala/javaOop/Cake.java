/* Imagine a Cake.
 When we think of a Cake we usually think of its finger licking flavour
 and while buying a Cake we first check its availability along with its price
 in the bakery shop. So let us create a class for Cake.
 The class Cake should contain instance variable of cakeName, price, flavour
 and isAvailable or not.

After you have created a class of Cake,
create an object for your favorite cake.
Mine is "Black Forest", so I will go ahead and create its object.
You too do the same.
